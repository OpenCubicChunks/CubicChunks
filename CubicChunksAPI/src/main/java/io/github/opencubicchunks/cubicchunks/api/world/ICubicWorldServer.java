     * Unloads or schedules unloading of no longer needed chunks from the world.

     * There are generally only a few valid uses of this method:
     *  * Generating a lot of new chunks (for example pregenerating terrain)
     *  * On user command
     *
     * Note: there are known bugs caused by this method in some situations,
     * that cause a chunk that contains a player to be unloaded when the player is moving
     * at very high speed. This is very unlikely to happen and has never been reported
     * outside of artificially created test setup with special player movement code.
     * This issue is probably not fixable. Automatic chunk unloading is not affected.
